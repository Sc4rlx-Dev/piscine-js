- **Business logic implementation** - Translating requirements into code

## 📊 Features Demonstrated

### Data Generation
Each example includes realistic sample data generators that create:
- Complex nested objects with multiple properties
- Realistic value ranges and distributions
- Edge cases (empty arrays, null values, missing data)
- Large datasets for performance testing

### Business Logic
Real-world business rules and calculations:
- Multi-criteria filtering with weighted scoring
- Time-based analysis and trending
- Permission and role-based access control
- Financial calculations with compliance requirements
- Academic grading systems with complex rubrics

### Performance Considerations
- Early termination techniques for large datasets

- Batch processing for large operations

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing data
- Validation of input parameters
- Recovery from malformed data
- Logging and debugging techniques

## 🛠 Utility Functions

Each example includes practical utility functions:
- **Data export** (JSON, CSV formats)
- **Formatting helpers** (currency, dates, percentages)
- **Search and pagination** 
- **Validation and sanitization**
- **Statistical calculations**

## 📈 Advanced Techniques

### Method Chaining
Complex operations combining multiple array methods:
```javascript
const result = data
  .filter(item => item.isActive)
  .map(item => transformItem(item))
  .reduce((acc, item) => aggregateData(acc, item), {})
  .sort((a, b) => compareItems(a, b));
```

### Functional Composition
Building complex operations from simple functions:
```javascript
const processOrders = pipe(
  filterCompletedOrders,
  calculateTotals,
  groupByCustomer,
  sortByValue
);
```

### Performance Optimization
Techniques for handling large datasets:
```javascript
// Early termination
const findFirstMatch = (array, predicate) => {
  for (const item of array) {
    if (predicate(item)) return item;
  }
  return null;
};

// Batch processing
const processBatches = (array, batchSize, processor) => {
  const results = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i += batchSize) {
    const batch = array.slice(i, i + batchSize);
    results.push(...processor(batch));
  }
  return results;
};
```
